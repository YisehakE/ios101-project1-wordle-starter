## Notes

**Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.**

As far as implementation, this was pretty simple and fun! The troubles more so
occurred during the optional stretch feature steps. 

- For the 1st optional step (*i.e adding asset to launch screen and app icon*), the issues ensued when trying to put the image asset set onto the app-icon. 
    - This was resolved by fixing the image size to be 1024x1024 instead of 255x255. 

- For the 2nd optional step (*i.e deploying app to my iPhone 15 Pro Max*), there were hurdles setting up '*Developer Mode*' on my iPhone, a seemingly ongoing issue in the iOS development community. 
   - This was resolved by simply turning dev mode off and on a 2nd time, with restarting my device in the process.
